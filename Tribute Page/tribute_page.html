        Here is a timeline in the life of Marcus Garvey.
      </h3>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>Born in St. Ann's Bay Jamaica, on the 17th of August 1887</li>
        <li>Was formally educated to a primary school level but was unable to continue formal education as his father could not afford further education for him.</li>
        <li>1905-1909: Started his professional career in the printery business. He then took an interest in trade union issues and became an advocate for the rights of workers. He soon became disgruntled with the inequalities drawn along racial lines he and his fellow black coworkers faced. He also attempted to establish his own printing press but with little success.</li>
        <li>1910-1914: In light of slow financial activity, Marcus Garvey went and travelled the world where he quickly saw the injustices faced by the black man around the world.</li>
        <li>1914-1916: Marcus Garvey returned to Jamaica and formed the United Negro Improvement Association(UNIA), which was a charitable organization which aimed to help the poor and destitute, while esposing ideas of black excellence.</li>
        <li>1917-1927: Marcus Garvey then travelled to the United States of America and established a UNIA branch in Harlem New York. There, the UNIA saw successes in various business ventures. The UNIA was able to attract a mass of black members from the lowly labourer to the loftier professionals such as doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. This created conflicts with other groups which were focused on racial integration rather than the upliftment of the black man. This also put him in the cross hairs of the establishment of the time and was subject to raids and harrassment. Marcus Garvey was ultimately brought before the courts on mail fraud charges and was sentenced to two years in prison, after which he was deported to Jamaica.</li>
        <li>Marcus Garvey continued his work from Jamaica and eventually migrated to England where he died in 1940.</li>
        <li>He was posthumously recognised for his work in the upliftment of the black race around the world by the Jamaican Government and he was bestowed the title of National Hero. His remains were returned to Jamaica in 1964 and reburied in the King George IV Memorial Park, now the National Hero's Park. </li>
